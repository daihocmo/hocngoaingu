# Hướng dẫn bắt đầu tự học ngoại ngữ
Hướng dẫn này sẽ là bản hiệu đính từ [trang học languageguide](https://sajforbes.nz/languageguide)

The approach is simple: start with the essentials. You don't need to read the full guide before you begin learning. If you are new to language learning, the main chapter is [Resources](https://sajforbes.nz/languageguide/resources/), but I recommend you read at least until the end of [Activities](https://sajforbes.nz/languageguide/activities/)---that's just a few pages. However, if you'd like a more solid foundation, I recommend you read on after that. You don't need to read the chapters in order, and you can skip around based on your preference.

For help reading this guide, here is a breakdown of the chapters:

-   **The Essentials**---These take you through the basics

    -   [Before you start](https://sajforbes.nz/languageguide/beforeyoustart/)---Key info to know before you begin

    -   [Resources](https://sajforbes.nz/languageguide/resources/)---The main chapter, containing guidance on what resources you need

    -   [Activities](https://sajforbes.nz/languageguide/activities/)---The best activities to do with your resources

    -   [Your Study Routine](https://sajforbes.nz/languageguide/routine/)---Covers your study habits

-   **Advice for Beginners**---These explain how to use your resources well, covering the key topics

    -   [Input](https://sajforbes.nz/languageguide/fullguide/)
    -   [Grammar](https://sajforbes.nz/languageguide/fullguide/)
    -   [Vocabulary](https://sajforbes.nz/languageguide/fullguide/)
    -   [Flashcards](https://sajforbes.nz/languageguide/fullguide/)
    -   [Speaking](https://sajforbes.nz/languageguide/fullguide/)
    -   [Pronunciation](https://sajforbes.nz/languageguide/fullguide/)
-   **Advice for Intermediate Learners**

    -   [Moving to the Intermediate Stage](https://sajforbes.nz/languageguide/fullguide/)---Advice on how your study changes later on

    -   [How to Learn Your Language](https://sajforbes.nz/languageguide/fullguide/)---Provides a framework you can use to build your ability

    -   [Choosing What to Study](https://sajforbes.nz/languageguide/fullguide/)---Helps you think about your strengths and weaknesses, and provides some ideas for improving

-   **Extras**---Some more advice on specific topics

    -   [Mistakes](https://sajforbes.nz/languageguide/fullguide/)---Ideas on how to deal with mistakes

    -   [Building Your Own Method](https://sajforbes.nz/languageguide/fullguide/)---Guidance for those looking to diverge from following the standard activities

    -   [Becoming Conversational in Lots of Languages](https://sajforbes.nz/languageguide/fullguide/)---Some people like to learn lots of languages less deeply, and this section shows you how it's done

    -   [Learning Theory](https://sajforbes.nz/languageguide/fullguide/)---A set of ideas about learning more generally, applied to language learning

    -   [The Final Chapter](https://sajforbes.nz/languageguide/fullguide/)---A quick summary with some parting words from me

Though there may seem to be a lot of information here, think of it as an investment. If you start with a bit of theory now, you will save time in the long run by doing it better the first time.
